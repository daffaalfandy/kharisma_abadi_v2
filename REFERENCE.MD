# Reference Documentation

This project is a complete rebuild of the Kharisma Abadi application.

## Important: Read This First

All analysis and planning documentation has been completed in a separate analysis project and copied to this project's `docs/` directory.

### Key Documents to Reference

**Must Read Before Starting:**
1. **`docs/planning/PRD.md`** - Product Requirements Document (BMAD method)
   - Contains all requirements, goals, and success criteria
   - Defines technology stack and approach
   - Lists all functional and non-functional requirements

2. **`docs/technical/TECHNICAL-SPEC.md`** - Technical Specification
   - System architecture design
   - Technology stack details
   - Database schema design
   - API design patterns
   - Security specifications
   - Testing strategy

**Business Logic Reference:**
3. **`docs/business-logic/business-rules-catalog.md`** - All business rules
4. **`docs/business-flows/README.md`** - Business process flows
5. **`docs/planning/user-stories.md`** - User stories with acceptance criteria

**Current System Analysis:**
6. **`docs/analysis/current-app-analysis.md`** - Current system overview
7. **`docs/database/schema-documentation.md`** - Database schema
8. **`docs/api/endpoints-catalog.md`** - Existing API endpoints

## Project Context

**Old Application:**
- Location: `~/personal/kharisma_abadi/`
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: Next.js
- Database: MariaDB (3+ years of production data)

**New Application (This Project):**
- Technology: [As per TECHNICAL-SPEC.md]
- Architecture: Clean Architecture / DDD
- Goal: Maintainable, scalable, modern codebase
- Data Migration: Preserve all existing data

## Development Phases Complete

- âœ… Phase 1: Analysis & Discovery
- âœ… Phase 2: Planning & Documentation
- ðŸ”„ Phase 3+: Implementation (Current)

## Original Project Location

The original application and analysis results are at:
`/Users/remotemac/personal/kharisma_abadi/`

The SQL backup for reference:
`/Users/remotemac/personal/kharisma_abadi/db-backup-scripts/backups/kharisma_db.sql`

## How to Use This Project

1. Read PRD.md and TECHNICAL-SPEC.md first
2. Follow the architecture patterns defined in technical specs
3. Refer to business-rules-catalog.md for all business logic
4. Use user-stories.md for sprint planning
5. Check business-flows/ for workflow diagrams
