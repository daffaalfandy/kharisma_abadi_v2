# BACKGROUND

## Executive Summary

**Kharisma Abadi** is a mature, multi-service business in Indonesia offering four core services:
- Car Wash (Cuci Mobil)
- Laundry Services (Laundry)
- Carpet Washing (Karpet)
- Drinking Water Delivery (Air Minum)

The current application, built with Flask (Python backend), Next.js 13 (React frontend), and MariaDB, has successfully served the business for **3+ years** with proven production stability. The system manages daily operations, employee tracking, customer data, and financial transactions with a database containing multiple years of critical business history.

### Current Situation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Operating Status** | Production (3+ years, actively in use) |
| **Data Volume** | 3+ years of transaction history preserved |
| **Daily Load** | 200-400 transactions/day |
| **Concurrent Users** | 2-4 cashiers per location |
| **Revenue Processed** | Millions of Rupiah monthly |
| **Critical Data** | Employee records, customer info, financial transactions |

### Why Rebuild?

The current system, while stable, has accumulated significant **technical debt** and faces **critical security gaps** that prevent:

1. **Scaling the business** - Current architecture cannot handle growth
2. **Adding features rapidly** - Changes require extensive refactoring
3. **Maintaining code** - New developers face steep learning curve
4. **Securing data** - Zero authentication, no access control
5. **Improving operations** - Limited visibility, automation gaps
6. **Modernizing infrastructure** - Outdated dependencies, security vulnerabilities

### Project Scope

| Element | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| **Timeline** | 5 months (20 weeks) |
| **Rebuild Scope** | Full application (backend + frontend) |
| **Data Scope** | 100% preservation of existing data |
| **Deployment** | Single-location initially, multi-location ready |
| **Downtime** | Minimal (1-2 hours for cutover) |

### Key Constraints

- **Database:** Must use existing MariaDB (data preservation critical)
- **Data:** All production data must be migrated with 100% integrity
- **Operations:** Business must continue during development
- **Team:** Likely small development team (2-3 developers)
- **Budget:** Cost-conscious (open-source stack preferred)

## Problem Statement

The current Kharisma Abadi application, despite being production-proven and stable, faces several critical challenges that prevent the business from growing and modernizing operations.

### Core Problems

**1. CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY**
- **Problem:** Zero authentication system; anyone with network access can:
  - View all business data (transactions, customer info, employee records)
  - Modify any transaction (change prices, employee assignments)
  - Delete records
  - Manipulate financial data
- **Impact:** Fraud risk, regulatory non-compliance, data breach liability
- **Current Mitigation:** None (air-gapped network only)

**2. MAINTAINABILITY CRISIS**
- **Problem:** Code organization makes updates difficult:
  - Business logic scattered across controllers
  - No service layer abstraction
  - Direct SQL queries (no ORM)
  - Hardcoded business rules (60/40 split in code)
  - Mix of old patterns and inconsistent styles
- **Impact:** Slow feature delivery, high bug risk, onboarding difficulty
- **Example:** Adding new discount type requires code change + deployment

**3. SCALABILITY LIMITATIONS**
- **Problem:** Architecture cannot efficiently handle growth:
  - N+1 query problems remain in some areas
  - No caching layer
  - Dashboard aggregates all transactions on every request
  - No pagination on legacy endpoints
  - Single-instance deployment
- **Impact:** Performance degrades with data growth, user frustration
- **Projection:** Current system reaches limits at 2-3x current load

**4. MISSING CRITICAL FEATURES**
- **Problem:** Core business functions not tracked:
  - Payment methods not recorded (can't distinguish cash vs transfer)
  - Payment status not tracked (paid, partial, unpaid unknown)
  - No refund mechanism (disputes not manageable)
  - No accounts receivable (invoice tracking manual)
  - Water delivery requires manual ordering (no automation)
- **Impact:** Financial management gaps, operational inefficiency

**5. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**
- **Problem:** Difficult for new developers:
  - Inconsistent patterns and styles
  - Limited documentation
  - Complex setup process
  - Slow development cycles
  - No automated testing (manual QA required)
- **Impact:** Expensive onboarding, retention issues

**6. TECHNICAL DEBT ACCUMULATION**
- **Problem:** 3+ years of:
  - Outdated dependencies (security vulnerabilities)
  - Inconsistent architectural patterns
  - Accumulated "quick fixes"
  - Legacy code patterns
  - Missing modernization
- **Impact:** Increasing maintenance costs, higher bug risk

### Business Impact

| Problem | Business Impact | Urgency |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Security vulnerability | Fraud risk, data breach liability, compliance issues | CRITICAL |
| Limited scalability | Cannot grow beyond current capacity | HIGH |
| Slow feature delivery | Competitive disadvantage, lost opportunities | HIGH |
| Maintenance costs | Growing expenses, reduced profitability | MEDIUM |
| Staff frustration | Difficult workflows, slower operations | MEDIUM |

### Why Rebuild Instead of Fix?

**Option A: Incremental Improvement**
- ‚úÖ Lower risk, continuous operation
- ‚úÖ Can deliver improvements in weeks
- ‚ùå Technical debt remains
- ‚ùå Architecture limitations persist
- ‚ùå 6-12 months to fully modernize

**Option B: Complete Rebuild (RECOMMENDED)**
- ‚úÖ Modern, clean architecture from start
- ‚úÖ Eliminate all technical debt
- ‚úÖ Future-proof for 5+ years
- ‚úÖ Better long-term maintainability
- ‚ùå Higher initial risk
- ‚ùå 5-month development timeline

**Decision:** **Complete Rebuild** is optimal because:
1. Small codebase allows faster rebuild than incremental improvement
2. Provides opportunity to implement modern best practices
3. Better long-term cost and maintainability
4. Enables future growth without rearchitecting

## Architecture Approach

### Architecture Pattern: Clean Architecture (Hexagonal)

**Philosophy:** "Entities must be testable in isolation"

Organize code into layers with clear dependencies flowing inward:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ      Presentation Layer (REST API)        ‚îÇ  Handles HTTP, converts to/from DTOs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ      Application Layer (Use Cases)        ‚îÇ  Orchestrates business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ      Domain Layer (Entities & Rules)      ‚îÇ  Pure business logic, frameworks-agnostic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ    Infrastructure Layer (DB, External)    ‚îÇ  Database, external APIs, services

        ‚Üì Dependency Direction ‚Üì
        (Inner layers independent of outer)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**Presentation Layer:**
- HTTP request/response handling
- Input validation (basic)
- Response formatting
- Error translation to HTTP codes
- **Must not:** Contain business logic

Example structure:
```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ carwash.py      # Car wash endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ laundry.py      # Laundry endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ water.py        # Water delivery endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.py         # Authentication endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/            # Request/response models (Pydantic)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ carwash.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common.py
```

**Application Layer:**
- Use cases / business workflows
- Coordinates domain entities and services
- Manages transactions
- Exception handling
- Logging
- **Must not:** Know about frameworks or HTTP

Example:
```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usecases/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ carwash/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create_order.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ complete_service.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ calculate_income.py
```

**Domain Layer:**
- Core business entities (CarWash, Laundry, Customer)
- Business rules and validations
- Pure business logic (no frameworks)
- Value objects
- **Only:** Depends on itself

Example:
```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ carwash.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employee.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payment.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ value_objects/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ money.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exceptions.py
```

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- Database access (repositories)
- External service integration
- Frameworks and libraries
- Configuration
- **Purpose:** Abstract all external concerns

Example:
```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persistence/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ carwash_repo.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ employee_repo.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py   # SQLAlchemy models
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ external/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sms_gateway.py
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py
```

### Design Principles

**SOLID Principles:**

**S - Single Responsibility**
- Each class/function has one reason to change
- Example: `CarWashService` only handles car wash logic

**O - Open/Closed**
- Classes open for extension, closed for modification
- Use inheritance, composition, and plugins

**L - Liskov Substitution**
- Derived classes replaceable for base classes
- Interface contracts respected

**I - Interface Segregation**
- Many client-specific interfaces better than one general
- Don't force clients to depend on interfaces they don't use

**D - Dependency Inversion**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions
- Inject dependencies rather than creating them

**DDD - Domain-Driven Design:**
- Organize code around business domains
- Use ubiquitous language (business terms)
- Separate domain logic from infrastructure
- Services represent business transactions

### Dependency Injection

**Pattern:** Inject dependencies rather than creating them

**Benefits:**
- Testable (inject mocks)
- Loosely coupled
- Configuration centralized
- Easy to replace implementations

**Example (Python with FastAPI):**
```python
from fastapi import Depends

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@router.post("/carwash/orders")
async def create_carwash_order(
    request: CreateCarWashRequest,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    auth: AuthService = Depends(get_auth_service)
):
    # Dependencies injected, easy to test
    pass
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- Use mocks for dependencies
- Fast execution (<100ms per test)
- High coverage target (>85%)

**Integration Tests:**
- Test multiple layers together
- Use test database (SQLite in memory)
- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Coverage target (>70%)

**E2E Tests:**
- Test complete user workflows
- Use browser automation (Playwright)
- Test against staging environment
- Coverage target (critical paths, >80%)

**Testing Pyramid:**
```
     ‚ï±‚ï≤         E2E Tests (5%)
    ‚ï±  ‚ï≤        Few, slow, valuable
   ‚ï±‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≤
  ‚ï±      ‚ï≤      Integration Tests (15%)
 ‚ï±‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≤     Some, medium speed
‚ï±          ‚ï≤
‚ï±‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ï≤   Unit Tests (80%)
              Lots, fast, focused
```

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration Approach

The existing 3+ years of production data must be migrated with 100% integrity. This is critical to business continuity.

### Phase 1: Schema Analysis & Mapping

**1.1 Analyze Current Schema**
- Document all tables, columns, types
- Identify relationships, constraints
- Find data quirks or inconsistencies
- Estimate data volume

**1.2 Design New Schema**
- Map old tables ‚Üí new tables
- Identify data transformations needed
- Plan for new features
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

**1.3 Create Migration Mapping Document**
```
Old Table          ‚Üí New Table    | Transformation
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
carwash_types      ‚Üí ServiceType  | Direct copy
carwash_transactions ‚Üí CarWashOrder | Add status field (default: COMPLETED)
carwash_employees  ‚Üí OrderAssignment | Direct copy
employees          ‚Üí Employee    | Add is_active=true
drinking_water_customers ‚Üí Customer | Direct copy
```

### Phase 2: Migration Scripts Development

**2.1 Extract Phase**
```python
# Extract data from old database
def extract_carwash_types():
    with old_db.connection():
        return db.execute("SELECT * FROM carwash_types").fetchall()
```

**2.2 Transform Phase**
```python
# Transform data to new schema
def transform_carwash_types(old_data):
    return [
        ServiceType(
            id=row.carwash_type_id,
            name=row.name,
            price=row.price,
            is_active=True,  # NEW field
            created_at=row.created_at,
            updated_at=row.updated_at
        )
        for row in old_data
    ]
```

**2.3 Load Phase**
```python
# Load data into new database
def load_carwash_types(new_data):
    with new_db.session():
        new_db.add_all(new_data)
        new_db.commit()
```

**2.4 Validation Phase**
```python
# Validate migrated data
def validate_carwash_types():
    old_count = old_db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM carwash_types").scalar()
    new_count = new_db.execute(
        select(func.count(ServiceType.id))
    ).scalar()
    assert old_count == new_count, "Data mismatch!"
    
    # Compare sample rows
    assert compare_sample_rows(old_db, new_db)
```

### Phase 3: Test Migration

**3.1 Staging Environment**
- Restore production database backup to staging
- Run full migration on staging
- Validate all data
- Test application against migrated data
- Measure performance

**3.2 Rollback Testing**
- Practice full rollback procedure
- Verify backup restore works
- Document exact steps
- Train team on recovery procedure

**3.3 Migration Checklist**
```
‚ñ° Source database backed up
‚ñ° Target database ready
‚ñ° Migration scripts written and tested
‚ñ° Validation scripts written
‚ñ° Rollback procedure documented
‚ñ° Team trained on procedure
‚ñ° Maintenance window scheduled
‚ñ° Communication sent to stakeholders
```

### Phase 4: Production Migration

**4.1 Pre-Migration**
- Announce maintenance window (24h notice)
- Final backup of production database
- Stop all applications accessing database
- Verify backup integrity

**4.2 Migration Execution**
- Run extract phase
- Run transform phase  
- Run load phase
- Run validation phase

**4.3 Post-Migration**
- Start new application pointing to migrated data
- Monitor for errors (first hour critical)
- Keep old database available for 24h (emergency rollback)
- Run final validation checks
- Communicate success to stakeholders

### Migration Timeline

| Step | Duration | Timing | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Schema analysis | 2 days | Week 16 | Document all mapping |
| 2. Migration scripts | 3 days | Week 16 | Develop and test |
| 3. Staging test | 2 days | Week 17 | Full validation run |
| 4. Rollback test | 1 day | Week 17 | Practice recovery |
| 5. Production prep | 1 day | Week 18 | Final checks |
| 6. Maintenance window | 2-4 hours | Week 18 | Execute migration |
| 7. Monitoring | Ongoing | Week 18+ | Watch for issues |

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Data loss during migration** | Low | Critical | Multiple backups, validation at each step, rollback capability |
| **Corrupted data migrated** | Low | Critical | Validation scripts, sample comparison, staging test |
| **Performance degraded** | Medium | High | Index verification, query optimization, load testing |
| **Application incompatibility** | Low | High | Thorough testing, staging validation |
| **Rollback unsuccessful** | Very Low | Critical | Practice rollback, keep old DB available |

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ 100% of data successfully migrated
- ‚úÖ All relationships maintained (zero referential integrity violations)
- ‚úÖ Validation scripts pass 100%
- ‚úÖ Application functions correctly with migrated data
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics achieved
