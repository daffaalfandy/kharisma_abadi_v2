## Critical Findings Summary

### 1. Hardcoded Business Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Income splits are hardcoded in controller logic, not database-driven

| Service | Split | Location | Impact |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| Laundry | 60/40 | `dashboard_controller.py:66` | Cannot change without code deployment |
| Carpet | 60/40 | `dashboard_controller.py:72` | Inconsistent with car wash (configurable) |
| Water | 60/40 | `dashboard_controller.py:89` | Business rule hidden in code |

**Recommendation:** Refactor to database-driven configuration like car wash service

### 2. Calculation Accuracy Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Floor division causes micro-losses in employee income

**Example:**
```
Total: 50,000 Rupiah, 3 employees
Current: 16,666 √ó 3 = 49,998 (2 Rupiah lost)
```

**Recommendation:** Implement remainder distribution or track fractional amounts

### 3. Service Differentiation Ambiguity (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Laundry and carpet share same table, differentiated by item unit type

**Edge case:** Mixed transactions (items with "kg" AND "m2") classified as carpet

**Recommendation:** Add explicit `service_type` field at transaction level

## What's NOT Applicable (System Doesn't Have These)

Based on code analysis, the following skill requirements are **not applicable** because the system doesn't implement these features:

1. **User Authentication Logic** - System has ZERO authentication (documented in security assessment)
2. **Payment Gateway Integration** - No payment processing logic found
3. **SMS/Email Notifications** - No integration logic found
4. **Inventory Management** - System doesn't track inventory
5. **Queue Management** - No queue system found
6. **Scheduling Algorithms** - No scheduling logic found
7. **Discount Logic** - No discount system found
8. **Tax Computations** - No tax logic found (prices are final)
9. **Approval Workflows** - No approval logic found
10. **Refund Rules** - No refund logic found

**All of the above are already documented in the main analysis** (`docs/analysis/current-app-analysis.md`) as missing features or security gaps.

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use

‚úÖ **All core deliverables are complete and ready for:**
- Development team onboarding
- Rebuild implementation
- Test case writing
- Business validation
- Architecture planning

### Optional Enhancements (If Requested)

If the team wants additional documentation, we could add:

1. **Separate Constants Document** (Low priority)
   - Extract all hardcoded values into dedicated file
   - Currently integrated in calculation-formulas.md

2. **Detailed Decision Tables** (Low priority)
   - Create formal decision tables for pricing logic
   - Current flowcharts are sufficient for simple logic

3. **Extended Code Mapping** (Low priority)
   - Create reverse mapping (file ‚Üí rules)
   - Current mapping is rule ‚Üí file

**However, these are NOT necessary** - core analysis is complete.
