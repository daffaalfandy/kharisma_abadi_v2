## 1. Car Wash Income Calculations

### 1.1 Employee Cut Calculation

**Business Rule:** Car wash income is split between the business and employees based on configurable cut rules.

**Formula:**

```python
# Two types of cut calculation:
if cut_type == 1:
    # Type 1: Fixed amount per transaction
    employee_cut = cut_amount
else:
    # Type 2: Percentage of final price
    employee_cut = final_price * (cut_amount / 100)

# Business net income
net_income = gross_income - employee_cut
```

**Parameters:**
- `cut_type`: 1 = Fixed amount, 2 = Percentage
- `cut_amount`: Amount (Rupiah) or percentage value
- `final_price`: Transaction total price
- `gross_income`: Total revenue from transaction

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:24-27`
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:343-346`

**Example:**

| Scenario | cut_type | cut_amount | final_price | employee_cut | net_income |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Fixed | 1 | 50,000 | 100,000 | 50,000 | 50,000 |
| Percentage (30%) | 2 | 30 | 100,000 | 30,000 | 70,000 |

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Cut rules are stored in `carwash_types` table (`cut_type`, `cut_amount`)
- ‚úÖ This is **configurable** per service type
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only completed transactions** (where `end_date IS NOT NULL`) are included in income

---

### 1.2 Per-Employee Income Distribution

**Business Rule:** When multiple employees work on one car wash job, the employee cut is divided equally among them.

**Formula:**

```python
# Calculate total employee cut (from 1.1)
if cut_type == 1:
    total_employee_cut = cut_amount
else:
    total_employee_cut = final_price * (cut_amount / 100)

# Divide among employees
per_employee_income = total_employee_cut // total_employees  # Floor division
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/carwash_transaction_controller.py:88-91`
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/employee_controller.py:97-102`

**Example:**

| Scenario | final_price | cut_type | cut_amount | total_employees | per_employee_income |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fixed, 2 employees | 100,000 | 1 | 50,000 | 2 | 25,000 |
| Percentage, 3 employees | 100,000 | 2 | 30 | 3 | 10,000 |

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses **floor division** (`//`), so remainder is lost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Example: 50,000 √∑ 3 = 16,666.66... ‚Üí **16,666** per employee, 2 Rupiah lost
- üî¥ **ISSUE:** Small amounts are lost due to rounding

---

## 2. Laundry/Carpet Income Calculations

### 2.1 Laundry/Carpet Net Income

**Business Rule:** Laundry and carpet services use a **fixed 60% business cut**, with 40% going to employees/overhead.

**Formula:**

```python
# Gross income
gross_income = final_price

# Net income (60% to business, 40% to employees/costs)
net_income = final_price * 0.6

# Employee/overhead cut
employee_cut = final_price * 0.4
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:66` (carpet)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:72` (laundry)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:380` (chart calculation)

**Example:**

| Service | final_price | net_income (60%) | employee_cut (40%) |
|---------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Laundry | 100,000 | 60,000 | 40,000 |
| Carpet | 250,000 | 150,000 | 100,000 |

**Important Notes:**
- üî¥ **HARDCODED:** The 60%/40% split is hardcoded in controller logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT CONFIGURABLE:** Cannot be changed per service type (unlike car wash)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCONSISTENT:** Car wash has configurable cuts, but laundry/carpet do not
- üî¥ **ISSUE:** Should be configurable in database, not hardcoded

---

## 3. Water Delivery Income Calculations

### 3.1 Water Delivery Net Income

**Business Rule:** Water delivery uses the **same 60% business cut** as laundry/carpet.

**Formula:**

```python
# Gross income
gross_income = final_price

# Net income (60% to business)
net_income = final_price * 0.6

# Employee/overhead cut (40%)
employee_cut = final_price * 0.4
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:89` (income calculation)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:395` (chart calculation)

**Example:**

| Quantity (Gallons) | Price per Gallon | final_price | net_income (60%) | employee_cut (40%) |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 5 | 10,000 | 50,000 | 30,000 | 20,000 |

**Important Notes:**
- üî¥ **HARDCODED:** Same issue as laundry/carpet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No per-gallon configuration in the formula shown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Final price calculation is done before this formula (quantity √ó unit price)

---

## 4. Employee Income Calculations

### 4.1 Employee Daily/Monthly Income

**Business Rule:** Employee income is calculated by summing all car wash jobs they worked on during the period.

**Formula:**

```python
employee_income = 0

for transaction in employee_transactions:
    if transaction['cut_type'] == 1:
        income_from_job = transaction['cut_amount']
    else:
        income_from_job = transaction['final_price'] * (transaction['cut_amount'] / 100)

    # Divide by number of employees on that job
    per_employee = income_from_job / transaction['total_employees']

    employee_income += per_employee

return employee_income
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/employee_controller.py:92-103` (day income)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/employee_controller.py:106-119` (month income)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/employee_controller.py:167-170` (by date range)

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Uses **precise division** (`/`), not floor division
- ‚úÖ Aggregates income across all transactions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only car wash jobs** are included (no laundry/carpet/water employee income tracked)

---

### 4.2 Employee Income by Date Range

**Business Rule:** Same as daily/monthly, but filtered by custom date range.

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/employee_controller.py:145-170`

**Filter Applied:**
```sql
WHERE date >= start_date AND date <= end_date
```

---

## 5. Laundry Item Pricing Logic

### 5.1 Item Price Distribution

**Business Rule:** When `final_price` differs from sum of (item price √ó quantity), apply adjustment to ensure total matches.

**Formula:**

```python
total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)

if final_price == total_price:
    # No adjustment needed
    for item in items:
        item['item_price'] = item['price'] * item['quantity']

elif final_price > total_price:
    # Extra charge - add to first item
    extra = final_price - total_price
    for j, item in enumerate(items):
        if j == 0:
            item['item_price'] = item['price'] * item['quantity'] + extra
        else:
            item['item_price'] = item['price'] * item['quantity']

elif total_price > final_price:
    # Discount - subtract from items sequentially
    cut = total_price - final_price
    for item in items:
        item_price = item['price'] * item['quantity']
        if item_price > cut:
            item_price -= cut
            cut = 0
        else:
            cut -= item_price
            item_price = 0
        item['item_price'] = item_price
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/laundry_transaction_controller.py:26-56` (helper function)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/laundry_transaction_controller.py:91-114` (list endpoint)
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/laundry_transaction_controller.py:178-201` (carpet list)

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Item Prices | final_price | Adjustment | Result |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Match** | [10000, 20000] | 30,000 | None | [10000, 20000] |
| **Extra Charge** | [10000, 20000] | 35,000 | +5,000 to item[0] | [15000, 20000] |
| **Discount** | [10000, 20000] | 25,000 | -5,000 from item[0] | [5000, 20000] |
| **Large Discount** | [10000, 20000] | 15,000 | -10,000 (item[0]), -5,000 (item[1]) | [0, 15000] |

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Extra charge** always added to **first item**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Discount** applied sequentially (first item first, then second, etc.)
- üî¥ **ISSUE:** No business justification for why first item gets extra charge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This allows cashier to adjust final price without changing item prices

---

## 6. Transaction Aggregations

### 6.1 Total Income Calculation

**Business Rule:** Sum gross income and net income across all services.

**Formula:**

```python
total_gross = carwash_gross + laundry_gross + carpet_gross + water_gross
total_net = carwash_net + laundry_net + carpet_net + water_net
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:94-101`

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Aggregates across all service types
- ‚úÖ Provides both gross and net totals
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only completed transactions** included (where `end_date IS NOT NULL`)

---

### 6.2 Transaction Count by Period

**Business Rule:** Count transactions by day, month, year, or all-time.

**Filters:**

| Period | SQL Filter |
|--------|------------|
| **Today** | `WHERE date = CURDATE()` |
| **This Month** | `WHERE date >= DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%Y-%m-01')` |
| **This Year** | `WHERE date >= DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%Y-01-01')` |
| **All Time** | No filter |

**Additional Filter:** Only completed transactions (`end_date IS NOT NULL`)

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:198-202` (comments)
- Database queries in model layer

**Important Notes:**
- ‚úÖ Uses **database server date** (NOW(), CURDATE())
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on database timezone configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Today" means server date, not user's timezone

---

## 7. Summary of Hardcoded Values

### 7.1 Income Split Percentages

| Service | Business Cut | Employee/Overhead Cut | Configurable? |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Car Wash | Variable (per type) | Variable (per type) | ‚úÖ Yes (in database) |
| Laundry | **60%** | **40%** | ‚ùå No (hardcoded) |
| Carpet | **60%** | **40%** | ‚ùå No (hardcoded) |
| Water Delivery | **60%** | **40%** | ‚ùå No (hardcoded) |

**Code Locations:**
- Laundry: `dashboard_controller.py:72, 380, 523`
- Carpet: `dashboard_controller.py:66`
- Water: `dashboard_controller.py:89, 395, 538`

**Recommendation:** üî¥ Move to database configuration like car wash

---

### 7.2 Chart Type Constants

```python
# Chart type parameter values
type = 1  # Total (all services)
type = 2  # Car wash only
type = 3  # Laundry only
type = 4  # Carpet only
type = 5  # Drinking water only
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/dashboard_controller.py:328`

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Document in API, or use enum

---

### 7.3 Service Type Constants

```python
# Service type identifiers (in job-type union query)
type = 1  # Car wash
type = 2  # Laundry
type = 3  # Water delivery
```

**Code Location:**
- `be-kharisma-abadi/controller/type_controller.py:52-59, 76-83`

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Use enum or constants file

---

## 8. Critical Business Rules

### 8.1 Transaction Completion Rule

**Rule:** A transaction is only included in income calculations if it has been marked as completed.

**Implementation:**
```python
if transaction['end_date'] is not None:
    # Include in income calculation
else:
    # Skip (pending transaction)
```

**Impact:**
- Pending transactions do NOT appear in income reports
- Completion date (`end_date`) acts as a status field
- **No explicit status field** exists

**Code Location:** Throughout dashboard controller (lines 21, 51, 83, 340, 377, 392)

**Recommendation:** üî¥ Consider adding explicit `status` enum field instead of relying on NULL date

---

### 8.2 Service Differentiation Rule (Laundry vs Carpet)

**Rule:** Laundry and carpet transactions are stored in the same table (`laundry_transactions`) and differentiated by item units.

**Implementation:**
```python
is_carpet = False
for item in transaction['items']:
    if item['unit'].lower() in ['m', 'm2']:
        is_carpet = True
        break
```

**Units:**
- **Laundry:** "pcs", "kg", "lusin", etc.
- **Carpet:** "m", "m2" (square meters)

**Code Location:**
- `dashboard_controller.py:55-57, 370-372`
- `laundry_transaction_controller.py:138-140`

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A transaction can be marked as carpet if **any** item has unit "m" or "m2"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed transactions (carpet + laundry items) will be classified as carpet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Case-insensitive matching (lowercase conversion)

**Recommendation:** üî¥ Consider separate tables or explicit `service_category` field

---

### 8.3 Pagination Limits

**Rule:** Pagination has maximum bounds to prevent excessive data loading.

**Limits:**
```python
if per_page < 1 or per_page > 100:
    per_page = 20  # Default to 20 if out of bounds
```

**Default:**
- Default `per_page` = 20
- Maximum `per_page` = 100
- Minimum `page` = 1

**Code Location:**
- `carwash_transaction_controller.py:25-26`
- `employee_controller.py:25-26`
- Similar pattern across all controllers

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Good practice, prevents abuse

---

## 9. Calculation Accuracy Issues

### 9.1 Floor Division in Employee Income

**Issue:** Using floor division (`//`) loses fractional Rupiah.

**Example:**
```python
cut_amount = 50,000
total_employees = 3
per_employee = cut_amount // total_employees  # = 16,666
# Lost: 2 Rupiah (50,000 - 16,666 * 3 = 2)
```

**Impact:**
- Small amounts are lost in division
- Accumulates over many transactions
- Business loses micro amounts

**Recommendation:** üü° Use precise division and round, or track remainders

---

### 9.2 Float Precision in Income Calculations

**Issue:** Using `float()` conversion may introduce precision errors.

**Example:**
```python
net_income = float(final_price) * 0.6
```

**Impact:**
- Potential rounding errors in large sums
- May cause small discrepancies in reports

**Recommendation:** üü° Use `Decimal` type for financial calculations

---

## 10. Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **üî¥ Make Laundry/Carpet/Water Income Splits Configurable**
   - Move 60%/40% split to database (like car wash)
   - Allow per-service-type configuration
   - Add UI for changing percentages

2. **üî¥ Add Explicit Transaction Status Field**
   - Replace `end_date IS NULL` check with `status` enum
   - Values: PENDING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
   - More explicit and maintainable

3. **üî¥ Separate Laundry and Carpet Tables**
   - Or add `service_category` field
   - Prevents ambiguity with mixed transactions
   - Clearer data model

### Medium Priority

4. **üü° Use Decimal for Financial Calculations**
   - Replace float with Decimal type
   - Prevents precision errors
   - Standard practice for money

5. **üü° Fix Floor Division Issue**
   - Use precise division with rounding
   - Or distribute remainder to first employee
   - Document rounding policy

6. **üü° Document Item Price Adjustment Logic**
   - Why does first item get extra charge?
   - Create business rule document
   - Consider UI to show adjustment

### Low Priority

7. **‚ö†Ô∏è Create Constants/Enums**
   - Chart types (1-5)
   - Service types (1-3)
   - Centralize in config file

8. **‚ö†Ô∏è Add Unit Tests for Calculations**
   - Test all formula variations
   - Test edge cases (division by zero, negative values)
   - Ensure precision

---

## Conclusion

The current system has **well-defined income calculations** for car wash (configurable) but **hardcoded percentages** for laundry, carpet, and water delivery. The biggest risk for rebuild is losing these hardcoded formulas since they're not in database or configuration.

**Critical Preservation:**
- Car wash: `cut_type` and `cut_amount` logic
- Laundry/Carpet/Water: **60% business, 40% employees** (hardcoded)
- Employee distribution: Division by employee count
- Item price adjustment: First item gets extras/discounts
- Completion rule: `end_date IS NOT NULL`

**Must Document in New System:**
- All percentage splits (especially the hardcoded 60%/40%)
- Employee income division algorithm
- Transaction completion logic
- Service differentiation rules
