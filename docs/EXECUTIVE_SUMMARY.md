## Health Scores

| Aspect | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Security** | üî¥ 2/10 | Critical - No authentication |
| **Performance** | üü° 5/10 | Needs optimization |
| **Code Quality** | üü° 4/10 | Technical debt exists |
| **Business Logic** | üü¢ 8/10 | Well-defined |
| **Production Stability** | üü¢ 9/10 | Proven 3+ years |
| **Overall** | üü° 4/10 | Functional but needs modernization |

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Security Gaps (CRITICAL - Priority 1)

| Issue | Impact | Severity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **No authentication/authorization** | API completely open to anyone | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| **CORS allows all origins** | Cross-site request vulnerability | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| **No input sanitization** | SQL injection risk | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| **No rate limiting** | DoS vulnerability | üî¥ CRITICAL |

**Estimated Impact:** High security risk, data breach possible
**Recommendation:** Implement JWT authentication immediately (Phase 2)

### 2. Hardcoded Business Logic (HIGH - Priority 2)

| Service | Issue | Impact |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Laundry | 60/40 income split hardcoded | Cannot change without code deployment |
| Carpet | 60/40 income split hardcoded | Inconsistent with car wash (configurable) |
| Water | 60/40 income split hardcoded | Business rules hidden in code |

**Location:** `dashboard_controller.py:66,72,89`
**Recommendation:** Refactor to database-driven configuration (Phase 3)

### 3. Schema Drift (HIGH - Priority 2)

**Issue:** Production database differs from base `database.sql` file

**Impact:**
- `carwash_employees` has evolved (added PK, unique constraint)
- Base schema is outdated and unreliable
- Risk of data loss in rebuild if using wrong schema

**Recommendation:** Extract and use production schema (Immediate)

### 4. Calculation Accuracy Issues (MEDIUM - Priority 3)

**Issue:** Floor division in employee income causes micro-losses

**Example:**
```
Total: 50,000 Rupiah √∑ 3 employees = 16,666 each
Distributed: 16,666 √ó 3 = 49,998
Loss: 2 Rupiah per transaction
```

**Impact:** Small losses accumulate, accounting discrepancies
**Recommendation:** Implement remainder distribution (Phase 3)

### 5. Technical Debt (MEDIUM - Priority 3)

| Category | Issues |
|----------|--------|
| **Dependencies** | 14 packages with security vulnerabilities |
| **Code Quality** | No service layer, direct SQL in controllers |
| **Testing** | Zero automated tests |
| **Documentation** | Limited inline documentation |

**Recommendation:** Address during rebuild (Phase 2-3)
